## Giveindia coding test solution.

### the mongodb atlas url is in the .env file to see the database just copy paste that url in mongodb compass.

### how to install

### 1. clone this git repo

### 2. go to the cloned folder and find the folder GiveIndia

### 3. open the folder in a terminal

### 4. type and run the command "npm install" these will install all the required packages

### 5. after installtion type and run the command "npm start"

### 6. the server will start on port 8080 so in your api testing app like Postman or Insomnia write "localhost:8080" and the routes (look into the routes folder in the Giveindia folder to find all the correct routes)

## OR

### use this heroku deployed link instead https://giveindiatest.herokuapp.com/ :-)

### to test the "BasicSavings" Test case use these 2 account numbers "79-992-7017" & "76-517-4118" these are the only 2 basicsaving account created randomly.
